Tubes were beadbeat using BioSpec Products Inc. Minibeadbeater-16 for 1 min and incubated at 95?C for 10 min. The remaining steps were preformed as per manufacturer protocol. DNA was eluted with 100 uL buffer EB (Qiagen) and stored at _20?C. For each sample, we amplified the 16s rRNA gene using the reverse primer 5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNN CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3_ and the forward primer 5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_. The underlined sequences are the 454 Life Sciences primer B (forward) and A (reverse). The italicized sequence is the broad range bacterial primer BSR357 (reverse) and BSF8 (forward). Each reverse primer contained a unique 8-nt error-correcting Hamming barcode (designated by NNNNNNNN) used to tag each PCR product. Duplicate 25uL reactions were carried out with AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) under the following reaction conditions: 2.5 uL 10_ Buffer 2, 0.4 uL Taq, 11.1 uL PCR-grade H2O, 0.5 uL forward primer and 0.5 uL reverse primer (20 pmol/uL each) and 10 uL template DNA. PCR reactions were assembled in a PCR bay in which all surfaces and pipettes had been decontaminated with DNA AWAY (Molecular BioProducts). Reactions were run on a Applied Biosystems Veriti thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95?C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95?C for 30 seconds, annealing at 56?C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 C for 90 seconds, with a final extension of 8 min at 72?C. Replicate amplicons were pooled and visualized on 0.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Amplicons were bead purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) as per manufacturer instructions. Purified amplicons were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen) and pooled in equimolar ratios.

Tubes were beadbeat using BioSpec Products Inc. Minibeadbeater-16 for 1 min and incubated at 95?C for 10 min. The remaining steps were preformed as per manufacturer protocol. DNA was eluted with 100 uL buffer EB (Qiagen) and stored at _20?C. For each sample, we amplified the 16s rRNA gene using the reverse primer 5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNN CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3_ and the forward primer 5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_. The underlined sequences are the 454 Life Sciences primer B (forward) and A (reverse). The italicized sequence is the broad range bacterial primer BSR357 (reverse) and BSF8 (forward). Each reverse primer contained a unique 8-nt error-correcting Hamming barcode (designated by NNNNNNNN) used to tag each PCR product. Duplicate 25uL reactions were carried out with AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) under the following reaction conditions: 2.5 uL 10_ Buffer 2, 0.4 uL Taq, 11.1 uL PCR-grade H2O, 0.5 uL forward primer and 0.5 uL reverse primer (20 pmol/uL each) and 10 uL template DNA. PCR reactions were assembled in a PCR bay in which all surfaces and pipettes had been decontaminated with DNA AWAY (Molecular BioProducts). Reactions were run on a Applied Biosystems Veriti thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95?C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95?C for 30 seconds, annealing at 56?C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 C for 90 seconds, with a final extension of 8 min at 72?C. Replicate amplicons were pooled and visualized on 0.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Amplicons were bead purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) as per manufacturer instructions. Purified amplicons were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen) and pooled in equimolar ratios.

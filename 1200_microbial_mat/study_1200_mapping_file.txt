Culture-independent rRNA community profiling instead revealed these microbial mats as among the most phylogenetically diverse environments known.  A preliminary molecular survey of the GN mat based on only ~1500 small subunit rRNA gene sequences discovered several new phylum-level groups in the bacterial phylogenetic domain and many previously undetected lower-level taxa.  We determined an additional ~119,000 nearly full-length sequences and 28,000 >200 nucleotide 454 reads from a ten-layer depth profile of the GN mat. With this unprecedented coverage of long sequences from one environment we confirm the mat is phylogenetically stratified, presumably corresponding to light and geochemical gradients throughout the depth of the mat. Previous shotgun metagenomic data from the same depth profile show the same stratified pattern and suggest that metagenome properties may be predictable from rRNA gene sequences.  We verify previously identified novel lineages and identify new phylogenetic diversity at lower taxonomic levels, for example, thousands of operational taxonomic units at the family-genus levels differ considerably from known sequences. The new sequences populate parts of the bacterial phylogenetic tree that previously were poorly described, but indicate that any comprehensive survey of GN diversity has only begun. Finally, we show that taxonomic conclusions are generally congruent between Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies, with the taxonomic resolution achieved dependent on the abundance of reference sequences in the relevant region of the rRNA tree of life.	4.155799349	GN_microbial_mat_454	3.305699587	2006	2006	0.0	ENVO:microbial mat	FASTA	30.12954528	GAZ:Mexico	Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat	GN_microbial_mat_454	JGI	1,g	Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat	8	-114.0577	y	18.70109707	1200	48.83064235	Sample Collection and Sequencing.  Microbial mat samples were collected as cores (~1 cm x 5 cm) at ~14:00 from pond 4 (near pond 5) at the Exportadora de Sal Saltworks, Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Cores were field sectioned unfrozen into 23 layers, 1 mm sections in the uppermost 1 cm and 3 mm sections in the lower mat. Sections from four cores taken within ~ 0.25 m2 were pooled to minimize influence of patchiness on the stratification profile. Dissected samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for transport to the laboratory. Genomic DNA was extracted from each layer by phenol:chloroform as described (Ley et al 2006).  Each sample DNA was used to construct two independent libraries.  PCR reactions to amplify 16S rRNA genes were conducted (30 cycles with annealing temperature of 52??C) with the bacterial domain-specific primers 27F and 1492R (Weisburg et al 1991). Eight independent PCR reactions were run with each template and 4 each were pooled for gel purification and cloning with the TopoTA sequencing kit (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer.  Clone colonies were robotically picked and sequenced.

Culture-independent rRNA community profiling instead revealed these microbial mats as among the most phylogenetically diverse environments known.  A preliminary molecular survey of the GN mat based on only ~1500 small subunit rRNA gene sequences discovered several new phylum-level groups in the bacterial phylogenetic domain and many previously undetected lower-level taxa.  We determined an additional ~119,000 nearly full-length sequences and 28,000 >200 nucleotide 454 reads from a ten-layer depth profile of the GN mat. With this unprecedented coverage of long sequences from one environment we confirm the mat is phylogenetically stratified, presumably corresponding to light and geochemical gradients throughout the depth of the mat. Previous shotgun metagenomic data from the same depth profile show the same stratified pattern and suggest that metagenome properties may be predictable from rRNA gene sequences.  We verify previously identified novel lineages and identify new phylogenetic diversity at lower taxonomic levels, for example, thousands of operational taxonomic units at the family-genus levels differ considerably from known sequences. The new sequences populate parts of the bacterial phylogenetic tree that previously were poorly described, but indicate that any comprehensive survey of GN diversity has only begun. Finally, we show that taxonomic conclusions are generally congruent between Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies, with the taxonomic resolution achieved dependent on the abundance of reference sequences in the relevant region of the rRNA tree of life.	0.854020772	GN_microbial_mat_454	3.305699587	2006	2006	0.0	ENVO:microbial mat	FASTA	34.1608309	GAZ:Mexico	Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat	GN_microbial_mat_454	JGI	1,g	Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat	7	-114.0577	y	23.91258163	1200	75.15382797	Sample Collection and Sequencing.

Culture-independent rRNA community profiling instead revealed these microbial mats as among the most phylogenetically diverse environments known.  A preliminary molecular survey of the GN mat based on only ~1500 small subunit rRNA gene sequences discovered several new phylum-level groups in the bacterial phylogenetic domain and many previously undetected lower-level taxa.  We determined an additional ~119,000 nearly full-length sequences and 28,000 >200 nucleotide 454 reads from a ten-layer depth profile of the GN mat. With this unprecedented coverage of long sequences from one environment we confirm the mat is phylogenetically stratified, presumably corresponding to light and geochemical gradients throughout the depth of the mat. Previous shotgun metagenomic data from the same depth profile show the same stratified pattern and suggest that metagenome properties may be predictable from rRNA gene sequences.  We verify previously identified novel lineages and identify new phylogenetic diversity at lower taxonomic levels, for example, thousands of operational taxonomic units at the family-genus levels differ considerably from known sequences. The new sequences populate parts of the bacterial phylogenetic tree that previously were poorly described, but indicate that any comprehensive survey of GN diversity has only begun. Finally, we show that taxonomic conclusions are generally congruent between Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies, with the taxonomic resolution achieved dependent on the abundance of reference sequences in the relevant region of the rRNA tree of life.	5.129548001	GN_microbial_mat_454	3.305699587	2006	2006	0.0	ENVO:microbial mat	FASTA	65.65821442	GAZ:Mexico	Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat	GN_microbial_mat_454	JGI	1,g	Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat	3	-114.0577	y	2.051819201	1200	58.47684722	Sample Collection and Sequencing.
